# React Pokedex

### Getting Started
This assignment will have you run through a tutorial on building a Pokedex using ReactJS.  Please follow the link to [Get Started](https://www.codementor.io/imbhargav5/building-a-pokedex-with-react-1-gdxwr8wee)

### Additionally
After you have completed the basic walk through please attempt the following.
- See if you can implement a search filter.  Place a search input on the screen that allows the user to filter the list of Pokemon.
- If you are looking for an even bigger challenge see if you can use the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/#pokemon) to allow the user to see additional information when a Pokemon is selected
