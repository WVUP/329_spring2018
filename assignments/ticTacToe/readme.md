Similar to last week we are going to go straight to the source for our next assignment.  I have went through this tutorial and found it very helpful in learning how and why things work with the React library.

We were going to review this in class tonight but it looks like we will have to call an audible and work on these independently.   Here is the url: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html

After going through the tutorial see how far you can make it on the following (also listed on the bottom of that page)

..... here are some ideas for improvements you could make, listed in order of increasing difficulty:

Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
Good luck and sorry for not being able to make it to class
